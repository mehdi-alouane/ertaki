####Installation
[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is used as a task manager for some tasks like Sass and Haml.

Make sure that [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) are installed.

#####Install Node packages

```javascript
npm install
```
####Build
This will build all the files to the build directory
```javascript
gulp build
```
Or 
```javascript
npm run build
```

####Development mode
This will start the development mode and initialize a localhost:3000 server to preview and watch file changes as you code, but make sure you run ```gulp build``` first.
```javascript
gulp serve
```
Or
```javascript
npm run serve
```
